	eigenstep.sage - need a better name for this

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

eigensteps.sage is a ugly sage script - more POC as actually usefull.

 - it is not interactive.
 - you have to set the starting values by yourself in the script.

 - you MUST provide a matrix lA with valid eigensteps.
 - this matrix MUST have the first row all zero.
 - you must provide valid values for N (number of frame vectors) and
   d (dimension of space)

That script is realy not for publishing
